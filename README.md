We humans made up of tiny cells , even small disturbance in cell can shake off entire human body it is always necessary to study about cells amd nucleus.Recent study has shown that we can change cells fate by changing its shape.We uses image processing toolbox to study geometric properties of cell from that we can predict physiological properties of cell. There are many image processing methods like snake algorithm ,3D active counter method an all . But as we know mostly people who study cells are not very familiar with programming so we tried to solve this problem by developing user friendly App so any one with least knowledge of programing can take benefit of it.We uses matlab App designer feature to built our app and we constantly try to improve our app.
